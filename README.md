# rxjs-kafka or rxkfk

A no fuss rxjs wrapper for kafkajs, focused on ease of use.

## Who?

Anyone who just wants to read/write Kafka topics from the comfort of reactive javascript.

## Getting started

> This section follows the same example as in KakfaJS docs (<https://kafka.js.org/docs/getting-started>)

Install rxkfk using yarn:

```bash
yarn add rxjs-kafka
```

Or npm:

```bash
npm install rxjs-kafka
```

Let's start by creating our RxJS subjects, using our Kafka brokers, topic and consumer details:

```typescript
import fromKafkaTopic from 'rxjs-kafka';
import { of, first } from 'rxjs';

const { message$, send } = fromKafkaTopic(
    {
        clientId: 'my-app',
        brokers: ['kafka1:9092', 'kafka2:9092']
    },
    { topic: 'test-topic', fromBeginning: true },
    { groupId: 'test-group' }
);
```

Now to produce a message to a topic, we'll subscribe `send` to an observable:

```typescript
of('Hello KafkaJS user!').subscribe(send);
```

Finally, to verify that our message has indeed been produced to the topic, let's subscribe an observer to the `message$` subject:

```typescript
message$.pipe(first()).subscribe(console.log);
```

Congratulations, you just produced and consumed your first Kafka message using RxJS and a bit of help from rxkfk!

## Limitations

-   only a single topic per subject (intended)
-   only JSON payloads (intended)
-   only pushing messages to a single topic (intended)
-   no transactions (intended, there is no equivalent mechanisms in RXJS and probably never will)

## Roadmap

-   expose `batche$$` subject to allow consume a whole batch from Kafka.
-   return an observable containing the operation result when producing messages, eg. `RecordMetadata[]` returned by `producer.send()`
-   using `eachBatchAutoResolve: true` might be problematic with `take()` or similar, since the whole batch is consumed but maybe fewer elements are delivered
